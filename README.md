## Common Arguments
- `pdf_path`: Specify the path to the PDF file you want to manipulate. This is a required argument.
- `--url`: (Upcoming feature) URL to be added to the PDF. Currently not implemented.
- `--exe`: Path to the `.exe` file you wish to embed within the PDF. Ensure the path is correct.
- `--command`: Command that will be added to the PDF's metadata. Useful for various applications.
- `--extract`: Flag to indicate that you want to extract text from the specified PDF. Use without additional arguments to save the extracted text.

## Examples
1. **Embed an `.exe` file**:
   ```bash
   python pdf_manipulation_tool.py document.pdf --exe example.exe
   ```
   This command will embed `example.exe` into `document.pdf`, creating a modified PDF with the executable.

2. **Add a command to a PDF**:
   ```bash
   python pdf_manipulation_tool.py document.pdf --command "This is a test command"
   ```
   This command will add the specified command as metadata to the PDF.

3. **Extract text from a PDF**:
   ```bash
   python pdf_manipulation_tool.py document.pdf --extract
   ```
   This command will extract the text content from `document.pdf` and save it to a text file named `extracted_text_from_document.txt`.

## Error Handling
**pdf_manipulation_tool** includes built-in error handling to provide informative messages. Here are some common errors and their messages:
- **File Not Found**: If the specified PDF file does not exist, you will see:
  ```
  Error: File '<pdf_path>' not found.
  ```
- **Invalid Executable Path**: If the provided `.exe` file path is incorrect or not a file, you will see:
  ```
  Error: '<exe_path>' is not a file.
  ```
- **PDF Processing Errors**: For any issues with reading or writing PDF files, appropriate error messages will be logged, such as:
  ```
  Error while processing PDF: <error_message>
  ```
- **Permissions Issues**: Ensure you have the necessary read/write permissions for the files and directories you are accessing.

## Future Improvements
- Implement the functionality to add URLs to PDFs.
- Enhance error reporting and logging for better debugging.
- Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier access to features.
- Add support for batch processing of multiple PDF files.
